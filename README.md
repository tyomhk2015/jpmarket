# TailwindCSS

In the past, Tailwind.css was a big CSS file have immense amount of combinations of CSS code. For the production deployment, there was a process of scanning and deleting unused CSS codes, before Tailwind V3. This process is called '<a href="https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production">purging</a>'. 

Thanks to JIT compiler, lightening the CSS file became possible. In other words, Tailwind.css will not hold all the combination of CSS codes that may have potential usage. Instead, Tailwind.css creates CSS codes on demand dynamically. As long as you don't write tailwind.css class names, no new CSS codes will be added to your project, more specifically in the ```<style>``` tag.

Tailwind.css do provide many class names for CSS, but you can also write customized CSS codes.
```
// Tailwind.css  =>  Customized Tailwind.css

text-lg => text-[99px]
text-black-900 => text-[#000]
bg-red-900 => bg-[#FF0000]

// For background images.
=> bg-[url('your/image/path.svg')]
```

# Prisma <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">üè†</a>

ORM for Node.js & Typescript, a translator for typescript and database.
<br>Instead of writing real SQL, Node.js & Typescript can be used for using database.

### schema.prisma ‚úèÔ∏è

A file that tells prisma how your database looks like, and how your data will be structured.

If prisma has information about the data or types, prisma can generate a client. ```Client``` is like a helper for talking to database using typescript.

### To run prisma on CLI

```
(‚ùå) $ prisma
(‚úîÔ∏è) $ npx prisma
```
